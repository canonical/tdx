    MSR(Model Specific Register) Class

    /dev/cpu/<num>/msr provides an interface to read and write the
    model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.  CPUNUM is the
    number of the CPU to access as listed in /proc/cpuinfo.

    The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to
    the MSR number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing
    in chunks of 8 bytes.  An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means
    multiple reads or writes of the same register.

    This file is protected so that it can be read and written only by
    the user root, or members of the group root.

    For more information about the MSR, please read https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/msr.4.html
