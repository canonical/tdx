## Intel TDX Tests

This folder contains Intel TDX tests.

### Pre-requisites

- The tests must be executed a host that has been setup properly for Intel TDX.

- Tox must be installed along with python3:
```
$ sudo apt install tox
$ sudo apt install python3
```

- You must specify a path to the guest image with `TDXTEST_GUEST_IMG` environment variable.
  This is for both pytest and checkbox tests.

- The guest image must enable ssh server with password-based authentication for `root` user.
  The root user password must be `123456`
